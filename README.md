# Kids Gaming Site

This project is a scaffold for a fun, interactive, and branded gaming website for kids ages 10â€“15. It demonstrates how organizational branding and content can be injected dynamically using JSON files.

## How Branding Works
- The site reads from `data/branding.json` for logo, favicon, slogan, contact info, and social media links.
- Theme colors and font are set via `data/branding.json.theme` and `data/theme.json`.
- All changes to these files are reflected immediately on reload.

## Customizing Branding
- Edit `data/branding.json` to update logo, favicon, slogan, contact, and social links.
- Edit `data/theme.json` for colors and font.
- Edit `data/games.json` to add or update games, site title, tagline, and countdown.

## Learning Checkpoints
- Look for `TODO: student exercise` comments in code and markup for extension ideas.
- Try adding new games, changing the theme, or improving accessibility.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit JSON files in `data/` and reload to see changes.
3. Explore and extend the code!
